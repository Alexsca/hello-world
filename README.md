# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Alexander. I am 22 years old and living in Gothenburg, Sweden with my dad. I am currently working for a pick-up company and in my freetime I spend most of my time with programming, friends, and squeezing in gym inbetween.

I don't really know where to write a commit message, but I'm going to guess it's here:
I have now introduced myself in this "readme" file.
